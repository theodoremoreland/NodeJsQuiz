# Node.js Quiz

A Node.js quiz through a Node.js command line program. The program can be used directly in a command line environment or indirectly via webpage. The latter leverages WebSockets and Node `child_process` to pipe input and output between web client and command line environment. The webpage is served using `Express.js`.

_This program was originally a homework assignment at LaunchCode's Lc101 (2019) originally named "Candidate Testing", which was a trivia quiz on random topics (written in Node.js). Since then, the subject of the quiz became Node.js itself and web support was added._
